Corrected (more precise overlap/non-overlap) labels for a small number of files from the SSPNet Conflict Corpus.

Files were adjusted with a focus on more precise overlap/non-overlap labelling, not speaker identity -> some speaker labels may be incorrect (e.g. in 06-11-08_1290_1320).

This is the version of the labels that was used in the SPECOM 2019 paper. It will be kept frozen for consistency. For an updated version, see ../SSPNEt_precise_updated.
